# BingoPartyCommands

You know why you're here:

## All available commands

Commands listed in the same line are aliases of one another, meaning they **achieve the same** thing equally, and exist to accommodate more users.

However, the one used in the primary column is how this feature is referred to in the documentation. Again, any will work, you can use whichever you prefer.

Features which work differently from Hypixel settings are explained.

## Command alias

E.g. using Skytils mod (open config under `/st`, then `Edit Aliases`):
- Left side: `ap`
- Right side: `msg BingoParty !p`

â€¦ and you'll be able to `/ap mute`, `/ap kick spammerIGN`, etc. just like that!
